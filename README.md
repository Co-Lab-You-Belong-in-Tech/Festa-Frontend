## Project Description

Festa is an application for Electronic Dance Music (EDM) concert and music festival goers to easily find upcoming concerts and music festivals in North America.

For EDM fans in North America who are looking for EDM festivals and concerts, Festa is an entertainment aggregator that allows them to find events to attend. Unlike a Google search, our product recommends events for you to attend, based on your musical taste.

## Features

List the key features and functionalities of your project. For example:

- Follow an artist: When a user signs up, during the onboarding process, there is a page that allows the user to follow some of their favorite artists by clicking on the check mark and then we are able to recommend concerts and festivals for you based on the artists selected.

- Adding events to Calendar App: As a user, you can add selected events to your calendar app so that you can plan your travel arrangements for the concerts or music festivals you will be attending in North America. This is done by clicking ont the share icon on the event details page, and an ics file is downloaded to your device.

- Adding events to favorites: As a user, you can add selected events to your favorites so that you can easily decide what events to attend and you can also reference the events you are most interested in attending on a later date or assist in planning out your travel schedule.
  This is done by clicking ont the heart icon on the discover page or on the event details page.
